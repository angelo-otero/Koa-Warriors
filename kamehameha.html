<p>Kamehameha I was a great Koa warrior that played an integral part in Hawaiian history. He was born in the Big Island of Hawai'i in 1758, the year in which Halley's Comet passed by the Hawaiian Islands. According to legend Hawaii's greatest king would move the Naha stone which weighed 7000 pounds. Kamehameha overturned it.</p>
<p>At the time he served under his uncle who was ruler of many districts on the island. When Captain Cook of the British Navy arrived on the island of Maui, his uncle brought him along to assess the threat the outsiders posed. The Hawaiians initially traded with the British, but relations with them quickly soured. As conflict erupted, Kamehameha took an active role in driving out the British, resulting in the death of Captain Cook.</p>
<p>When Kamehameha's uncle died in 1782, Kamehameha defeated his cousin and took control of the Big Island of Hawaii. With the help of Western weapons he eventually united all the Hawaiian Islands under his rule in 1810. He made alliances with other Westerners who helped keep him in power, but tightly controlled their trade and businesses in the islands. </p>
