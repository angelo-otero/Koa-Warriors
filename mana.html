<p>Belief in Mana is an important part of Polynesian culture. It is spiritual power or life energy. It can exist in people, places, and things. It is used for healing as well as a symbol of social power. Those with the most Mana, have the right to rule. For people it can be gained from sexual acts, or military victory (either by enslaving or eating enemies). It can be lost through military defeat or failing in sexual relationships.</p>
<p>Special places are thought to be abundant in Mana, and certain weapons inherited through generations are said to hold Mana from one's ancestors' victories. Living in these special places or possessing the special weapons are also said to increase one's Mana.</p>
