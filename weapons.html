<p>Metal weapons were very rarely used by the Koa and the "common" Hawaiian warriors. Stone, wood, and shark teeth were the staple materials for their weapons.  It wasn't until <a href="kamehameha.html">Captain James Cook</a> of the British Navy arrived in Oahu, that the Hawaiians used metal weapons, mainly muskets. Before that, they used slings, and throwing spears and axes serrated with shark teeth for ranged attacks. </p>

<p>When the opposing force was thinned from ranged attacks usually the "common" soldiers armed with a <em>pololu</em>, a 12-15 ft spear, would advance in formation, while the faster, stronger Koa would attempt to outflank the enemy formation or prevent their own forces from being outmaneuvered. The Koa preferred to use wooden clubs made from the Koa tree, where they get their name, which were sometimes serrated with shark teeth for slicing.</p>
