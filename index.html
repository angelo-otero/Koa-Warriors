<p>Before the islands of Hawaii were seen as a tourist hot spot, before the concept of <a href="aloha.html">"Aloha,"</a> Hawaii was a place rife with bloody conflict. Hawaii's elite warriors were known as <strong>the Koa.</strong> Like other cultures, the Koa were one of the upper classes in Hawaiian society. Similar to the Polynesian Maori warriors, the Koa didn't use armor, preferring fast-paced close quarters combat after weakening opposing forces with ranged attacks.</p>

<p> Since Hawaii wasn't rich with iron, nor did the Hawaiians discover metal forging, the Koa used stone, wood, and shark teeth as <a href="weapons.html">weapons.</a> The Koa also practised a unique form of martial arts called <em><a href="palua.html">Pa Lua.</a></em> One aspect that sets the Koa (and Maori) from other warrior classes in the world is their belief of <em><a href="mana.html">Mana,</a></em> or life energy, which can be taken from their opponents by enslaving or eating them. Despite not having metal armor or weapons, the Koa were effective in military campaigns against other Hawaiians and outsiders alike. </p>
